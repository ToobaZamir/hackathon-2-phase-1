# Prompt History Record: Plan Console Todo App

## Original Prompt

```
/sp.plan

Project: The Evolution of Todo - Phase I (In-Memory Python Console Todo Application)

Based on the existing specification:

Generate a comprehensive, phased technical plan for building the application using purely agentic/spec-driven development.

Key requirements from spec:
• 5 core features: Add task (title + description), View/List all tasks, Update task, Delete task by ID, Mark task as complete/incomplete
• In-memory storage only (no files/database)
• Clean, modular Python code (PEP 8, type hints where reasonable, docstrings)
• Intuitive command-line interface with menu
• Input validation and user-friendly error messages
• All code must be generated by AI agents (Claude Code + Qwen CLI) — no manual coding
• Project structure: src/ folder + proper package layout
• Windows users must use WSL 2

Plan structure guidelines:

1. High-level architecture overview
   - Main components/modules
   - Data model (how tasks will be represented/stored)
   - Recommended patterns (classes vs functions, separation of concerns)

2. Phased development roadmap
   Break the entire implementation into logical, sequential phases
   Each phase should be small enough to be implemented in 1–3 AI coding sessions

3. Suggested module/file structure
   List all expected files and their main responsibilities

4. Task breakdown per phase
   For each phase:
   - Clear description of what needs to be achieved
   - Key acceptance criteria
   - Suggested AI prompt focus areas
   - Potential edge cases to consider

5. Testing & validation approach
   (manual testing strategy since no test framework in Phase I)

6. Final deliverables checklist
   What the repository should contain at the end of Phase I

Keep the plan realistic for a hackathon timeframe and focused on producing high-quality, maintainable code through iterative AI generation.

Output in clear Markdown format with numbered phases and bullet points for readability.

# Implementation Plan: Console Todo App

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-01-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an in-memory Python console todo application that supports the 5 core features: Add, View, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete. The application will follow clean code principles with a modular architecture separating business logic from CLI interface. All development will be done through AI-assisted generation following spec-driven development practices.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution and spec)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external dependencies as per constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory storage using Python lists/dicts (as specified in constitution and spec)
**Testing**: Manual testing approach (as specified in spec - no automated testing framework for Phase I)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows via WSL 2, Linux, macOS) - console application
**Project Type**: Single project (console application)
**Performance Goals**: Response time under 1 second for all operations (as specified in spec)
**Constraints**: No persistence to files/databases, CLI interface only, max 500 characters for todo text, numeric IDs (as specified in clarifications)
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, local application, up to hundreds of todo items in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the constitution, this plan adheres to the following principles:
- ✅ Spec-Driven Development: All features originate from detailed specifications
- ✅ Simplicity and Focus: Prioritizing minimal viable functionality with in-memory storage
- ✅ Clean Code Standards: Will adhere to PEP 8, use meaningful names, modular structure
- ✅ Quality Assurance: Will handle edge cases and provide user-friendly error messages
- ✅ User Experience: CLI interface with clear prompts and status indicators
- ✅ Technology Constraints: Python 3.13+, no external dependencies, WSL 2 compatibility
- ✅ Documentation and Reusability: Capturing all development artifacts
- ✅ Ethical Guidelines: Simple text interface, no data persistence concerns

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected to match the simple console application scope. The architecture separates concerns with models for data representation, services for business logic, and CLI for user interface.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Phase 1 Completion

- [x] research.md generated with all technical decisions documented
- [x] data-model.md created with entity definitions and validation rules
- [x] contracts/ directory created with CLI API contract
- [x] quickstart.md created with setup and usage instructions
- [x] Agent context updated with new technology stack
- [x] Constitution Check re-evaluated and confirmed compliance
